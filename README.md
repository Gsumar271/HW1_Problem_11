By Y.S.

In this problem the goal was to create a class restaurant and then create 3 other classes derived
from that parent class in order to demonstrate polymorphism. The method to override was menu() 
and each of the 3 different restaurants had its own version of the method menu(). In addition each 
class would return itâ€™s own name from method Get_Rest(). I implemented the main method
by having user pick his favorite restaurant and then use class polymorphism to make a selection, 
 The menu was a returned as a long string of menu items for each class picked.
